# Biodiversity Dashboard

This project is an interactive dashboard developed with Shiny and `leaflet`, designed to visualize species occurrences geographically using biodiversity-related data. The dashboard is intended to display an interactive map of species distribution in Poland, allowing users to select specific species to view their occurrences.

Check the Dashboard on [Shinyapps](https://phfirmino.shinyapps.io/species-map/)

## Features

- **Geographical Occurrence Visualization**: Displays a map of Poland with species occurrences. Areas with higher numbers of occurrences are highlighted with varying color intensities.
- **Species Filter**: Users can select a species to filter the occurrences shown on the map.
- **Map Interaction**: The map allows zooming and direct interaction, with information displayed about each region when hovering the mouse over it.

## Technologies Used âš¡

- **Shiny**: A framework for building interactive web applications in R.
- **Leaflet**: A JavaScript library for creating interactive maps, used through the `leaflet` package in R.
- **dplyr**: For data manipulation.
- **sf**: For spatial data manipulation.
- **R**: The programming language used to develop the dashboard.
